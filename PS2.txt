How many 12s are in nums.txt?
	a. 15

How many numbers in the file begin with 14?

3. The system call took longer than the simple procedure call. The system call requires more time because a system call forces the OS to come in and handle the trap. The OS must check for permissions then entire kernel mode, get the appropriate handler, execute the task, then return back to user mode. This takes a lot longer than just jumping to a method and executing it.

4. 32

5.  Process A: Queue 1 
	Process B: Queue 4
	Process C: Queue 3 if MLFQ supports redemption
	Queue 4 if MLFQ doesn't support redemption
